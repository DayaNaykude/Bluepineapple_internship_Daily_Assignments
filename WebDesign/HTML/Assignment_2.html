    <p style="font-size: 18px">
      The four llamas and camels are camelids Camelids tend to be large and are
      strictly herbivorous.Camelids differ from ruminants in sevral ways.<br />
      They have a three- chambered rather than a four -chambered digestive
      tract,an upper lip that is spilt in two with each part seprately
      mobile;and an<br />
      isolated incisor in the upper jaw.They have long legs that,because they
      lack tensor skin to bridge between thigh and body,look longer still.(from
      Wikipedia)
